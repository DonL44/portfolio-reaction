# React Challenge: React Portfolio

## Description

For this challenge, I was asked to create a portfolio of my student web development projects using React.  
*Placeholders are acceptable, as this site will be updated as the course progresses*

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications  
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples  
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
